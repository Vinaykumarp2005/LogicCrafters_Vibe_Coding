Beyond the immediate concerns of bias and economics lies the broader technical frontier of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). While current AI is "narrow"—meaning it excels at specific tasks like playing chess or generating text—AGI represents a hypothetical system that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across any intellectual task a human can perform. The pursuit of AGI raises profound philosophical questions about the nature of consciousness and the potential for a "singularity," a point where AI begins to improve itself at an exponential rate, surpassing human comprehension. While experts disagree on the timeline for AGI, its potential existence serves as a North Star for research, driving innovations in reinforcement learning and multi-modal processing.
