JavaScript Frameworks and Modern Frontend

The JavaScript ecosystem has evolved rapidly, with powerful frameworks and tools that streamline web application development.

React.js, developed by Facebook, uses a component-based architecture with a virtual DOM for efficient rendering. React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext) simplify state management. The React ecosystem includes Next.js for server-side rendering, Redux for state management, and React Native for mobile development.

Vue.js offers a progressive framework that is easy to adopt incrementally. Its reactivity system, single-file components, and the Composition API make it developer-friendly. Nuxt.js extends Vue with SSR capabilities.

Angular, maintained by Google, is a full-featured framework with TypeScript at its core. It provides dependency injection, RxJS for reactive programming, and a comprehensive CLI for project scaffolding.

Frontend tooling has also advanced significantly:
- Webpack, Vite, and esbuild for module bundling
- TypeScript for type-safe JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Testing with Jest, Vitest, Cypress, and Playwright
- Package management with npm, yarn, and pnpm

The JAMstack architecture (JavaScript, APIs, Markup) has gained popularity for building fast, secure, and scalable web applications.
