Introduction to Web Development

Web development encompasses the creation and maintenance of websites and web applications. It is broadly divided into front-end and back-end development.

Front-End Development:
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) structures web content. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) controls presentation and layout. JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior. Modern front-end development relies heavily on frameworks and libraries like React, Vue.js, and Angular.

Back-End Development:
Server-side programming handles business logic, database interactions, authentication, and API design. Popular back-end languages include Python (Django, Flask), JavaScript (Node.js, Express), Java (Spring Boot), and Go.

RESTful APIs provide a standardised way for front-end and back-end to communicate. GraphQL offers a more flexible alternative for querying data. WebSockets enable real-time bidirectional communication.

Modern web development practices include:
- Responsive design for mobile compatibility
- Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) for offline support
- Single Page Applications (SPAs)
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for SEO
- Containerization with Docker for deployment
- CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
