Deep Learning Architectures and Training

Deep learning has transformed artificial intelligence by enabling models to learn hierarchical representations of data. The key architectures include:

1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Used primarily for image and video recognition. They use convolutional layers that apply filters to detect features like edges, textures, and shapes. Popular architectures include VGG, ResNet, and EfficientNet.

2. Transformers: The transformer architecture, introduced in "Attention Is All You Need," uses self-attention mechanisms to process sequences in parallel. This has led to breakthroughs in NLP (BERT, GPT) and computer vision (Vision Transformers).

3. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Consist of a generator and discriminator that compete, producing realistic synthetic data. Applications include image synthesis, style transfer, and data augmentation.

Training deep learning models requires careful consideration of:
- Loss functions (cross-entropy, MSE, contrastive loss)
- Optimizers (SGD, Adam, AdamW)
- Regularization (dropout, weight decay, batch normalization)
- Learning rate scheduling (cosine annealing, warm-up)
- Data augmentation strategies

Hardware acceleration through GPUs and TPUs is essential for training large models efficiently.
