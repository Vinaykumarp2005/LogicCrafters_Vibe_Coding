Machine Learning and Neural Networks

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning, a branch of machine learning, uses neural networks with multiple layers to model complex patterns in data.

Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data. The model learns to map inputs to outputs based on example input-output pairs. Common supervised learning algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.

Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, works with unlabeled data. The model tries to find hidden patterns or groupings in the data. Clustering algorithms like K-Means, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering are popular unsupervised methods.

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. A neural network consists of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons). Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are particularly effective for image recognition, while Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks excel at sequence data and natural language processing.

Transfer learning allows models trained on one task to be fine-tuned for another, reducing the need for large datasets. Pre-trained models like BERT, GPT, and ResNet have revolutionized the field.
