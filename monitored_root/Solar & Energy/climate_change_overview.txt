Climate Change: Causes, Effects, and Solutions

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. While natural factors contribute, human activities have been the primary driver since the industrial revolution.

Causes:
The burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) releases greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), into the atmosphere. Deforestation reduces the planet's capacity to absorb CO2. Industrial agriculture, particularly livestock farming, contributes significant methane emissions.

Effects:
- Rising global temperatures (1.1°C increase since pre-industrial times)
- Melting glaciers and ice caps, causing sea level rise
- More frequent and severe weather events (hurricanes, droughts, floods)
- Ocean acidification threatening marine ecosystems
- Biodiversity loss as habitats change faster than species can adapt
- Threats to food security and water resources

Solutions:
Transitioning to renewable energy sources (solar, wind, hydroelectric) is essential. Carbon capture and storage technologies can help mitigate emissions from existing infrastructure. Reforestation and sustainable land management practices can increase carbon sequestration.

The Paris Agreement aims to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Achieving this requires international cooperation, policy changes, technological innovation, and individual action.
